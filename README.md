```python
import pyttsx3
import requests
import json
import time

e = pyttsx3.init('sapi5')
v = e.getProperty('voices')
e.setProperty('voices', v[1].id)  # Use female voice (v[0] for male)
e.setProperty('rate', e.getProperty('rate') - 50)  # Slow down speech rate

def speak(audio):
    e.say(audio)
    e.runAndWait()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    speak("Hello, I am your reading assistant. And I am going to read news for you. Now the 1st News is by")

        speak(article['author'])
        print(article['title'])
        speak(article['title'])
        print(article['description'])
